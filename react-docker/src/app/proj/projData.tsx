This particular model was based off <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">a paper</a> by Ho et. al. We take a dataset of images (in this case, the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset">MNIST dataset</a> of handwritten numbers) and slowly add noise to the image. We train the diffusion model to "denoise" the noisy image to approximate the original image. After training, we input an image of complete noise to the model. Using the same process of denoising, the model effectively generates an image of a handwritten digit.</p>,
                    <p key="diffusion-mnist-1-3">The first version of the model "denoised" an image with 50% noise in one singular step. This served primarily as a warmup to iron out the major steps in denoising.</p>,

                    <p key="diffusion-mnist-1-5">To enable generating images from complete noise, I modified my model to iteratively denoise images over a number of timesteps. This way, we can start with complete noise and slowly approach a number. The resulting images after 20 epochs of training are below.</p>,

                    <p key="diffusion-mnist-1-7">Although the images are denoised, they don't necessarily resemble real handwritten numbers. To fix this, I added one more change to the model: I explicitly tell the model what number each training image corresponds corresponds to. When generating an image, we then specify what number we want an image of. This small change considerably improves the model in generating realistic images of handwritten digits.</p>,

The idea and process of diffusion models is the basis of many popular image generation models today (e.g., OpenAI's DALL-E, Stable Diffsion, etc.). Although this model is nowhere near as complex or powerful, I still had a blast learning and experimenting with this project.</p>,
