                I'm Jonathan, a Masters student in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I've worked in AI/ML, software engineering, UI/UX, and a variety of leadership roles (such as serving as Co-Director for HackIllinois 2023). Some of my favorites include weight lifting, <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i> by A. A. Milne, literally everything by Taylor Swift, and the show <i>Fellow Travelers</i>.
